# Hello World

Welcome to **Notes from my Desk**. This platform serves as a digital garden where I share my thoughts on software engineering, design, and the evolving landscape of technology.

## Why this blog?

I believe that writing is the clearest way to think. By articulating my experiences, I hope to not only solidify my own understanding but also contribute to the wider community.

### Tech Stack

This site is built with:

- **Next.js**: For performance and SEO.
- **Vanilla CSS**: For a bespoke, premium aesthetic.
- **Markdown**: For a seamless writing experience.

Stay tuned for more.
